00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,894
[suspenseful music]

[indistinct chatter]

[fire crackling]

00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,247
[sighs]

00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,007
[indistinct chatter]

10
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,887
Anya Davis?

11
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,849
Hi, I'm--
Sorry, I'm Cole Keating,

12
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,475
the philosophy department.

13
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,478
- Oh, hi.
- I was on the hiring committee.

14
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,230
- Right.
- Can I?

15
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,148
Yes, yes, yes.
Sure, sure.

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,569
Your dissertation
on the Nietzschean will

17
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,238
of individualism
was fascinating.

18
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,574
- Thank you.
- So, I really admire you.

19
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,826
You um-- You cover Nietzsche?

20
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,539
No, no, I focus on
the practices and aesthetics

21
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,876
of the 18th century,
so, Diderot, Voltaire.

22
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,502
- Right. Enlightenment.
- Yes.

23
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,257
Um, although I teach a survey
course here and there.

24
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,593
We're so lucky to get you.

25
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,012
Thanks. [chuckles]

26
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,015
Uh, so, will I see you
at the fire tonight?

27
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,435
Sorry, will you see me
at the fire tonight?

28
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,769
Oh, do you not--

29
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,731
- [chuckling]
- No.

30
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,817
Um, so back in 1886,
when Eastling was all men,

31
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,111
at the end of a term,

32
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,197
the students all decided
to burn their books.

33
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,325
It only happened once,

34
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,826
but it sort of
became a tradition.

35
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,787
Oh, yeah,
like a ritual of sorts, right?

36
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,666
Yeah, it's tonight.
So see you there?

37
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,878
Yeah, sure.

38
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,598
[soft piano melody]

39
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,893
[indistinct chatter]

40
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,381
Hi.

41
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,050
Hi.

42
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,888
- You're new.
- Yes.

43
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,142
I'm a new hire
in the philosophy department.

44
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,562
Anya-- Dr. Davis.

45
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:39,405
Do you believe in all that,
burning of books?

46
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,950
They say
it's this Eastling tradition,

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,077
the burning of literature
and the like.

48
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,163
It's actually a serious
practice with meaning.

49
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,623
I hear it's treated as a joke...

50
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,710
people just throwing
their shit into the fire...

51
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,004
leaving the world outside
behind.

52
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:00,467
When really,
what it actually means...

53
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,554
it's eliminating ideology that
may threaten any kind of power.

54
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,056
Burning a person...

55
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,308
burning a mind.

56
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,146
Yeah, I understand that.

57
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,565
So, basically,
all these lunatic co-eds

58
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,234
have taken this practice
and turned it

59
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,570
into a kind of celebration.

60
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,239
A reason to get drunk.

61
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,160
I don't think that's
what education should be about.

62
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,416
All right, Anya,
I think we're ready for you.

63
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,600
[Dean Johnson] Anya,
can I get you anything?

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,018
No, thank you.

65
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,354
This is Joanna Higgins.

66
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,191
She's investigating
the death of Wilder Hewitt.

67
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,569
[Joanna] We've spoken to all of
the students from your seminar.

68
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,863
Wow. All of them?

69
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,533
Except Mara Headley.
We can't get in touch with her.

70
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,160
- Have you heard from her?
- [Anya] No.

71
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,247
And Selena?

72
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,794
Selena Ferreira, my student?

73
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,961
We've spoken with her.

74
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:23,175
- So, she's okay?
- [Dean Johnson] Yes.

75
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,929
Okay.

76
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,680
We've learned you did
a recording of the class?

77
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,140
Reed Harris shared it with us.

78
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,434
Yes, uh, per my instructions,

79
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,895
I was required to record
all remote classes.

80
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,564
What's strange is
from this specific seminar,

81
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,274
the recording stops.

82
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,819
Is there
a reason you stopped it?

83
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,907
That I stopped the recording?

84
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,369
It stops with Reed Harris
saying, and I quote,

85
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,538
"The Upashans have
a theory about this."

86
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,541
He goes on to argue
with Molly Stanovitz.

87
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,835
It gets a little out of hand.
You call five minutes.

88
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,171
Yes, yeah, I had-- I had called
a break in the class.

89
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,466
Yes, and at that point,
someone stopped the recording

90
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,843
and didn't restart it.

91
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,554
We assumed that person was you.

92
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,853
[soft suspenseful melody]

93
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,955

Oh, hi, Mara. Hi.

104

- Hello? Hello, hello, hello?
- Hi, hi.

106
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,459
I can hear you.

107
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,502
- How are you?
- [Mara] <i>Um, I'm okay.</i>

108
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,463
<i>I mean, all my classes
have been on here,</i>

109
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,840
<i>- so I'm kind of--</i>
- [video call chimes]

110
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,884
- [Mara] <i>Hi, Reed.</i>
- Hi.

111
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,260
{\an8}Hey.

112
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,596
{\an8}- Did you just wake up?
- [phone buzzing]

113
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,806
[Reed] <i>Yeah, so?</i>

114
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,934
[Mara] <i>Oh, no. Sorry--</i>

115
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,352
- I'll be right back.
- [Reed] <i>Where's Wilder?</i>

116
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,645
{\an8}He's not with you?

117
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,397
{\an8}No, we, um...

118
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,070
{\an8}uh, we had a fight last night,
so I came back to my dorm.

119
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,822
{\an8}Oh.

120
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,784
{\an8}Cool.

121
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,125
{\an8}[Wilder] <i>This is Wilder.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

122

- [phone chiming]
- [Reed] <i>Hey.</i>

123
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,176
[Hanna] Hey.

124
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,180
[Reed] <i>You're not part of
this class unless somehow</i>

125

126
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,980
{\an8}<i>-Are you, like, here to troll?</i>
- Dr. Davis is my mom.

127
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,524
{\an8}- [soft music plays]
- What's that in your background?

128
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,150
{\an8}That's music.

129
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,653
{\an8}I knew that,
but I mean, like, what kind?

130
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,282
{\an8}- Hanna?
- Hi.

131
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,034
{\an8}How did you even get in here?

132
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,869
{\an8}Your calendar synced
to my phone.

133
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,580
{\an8}And all your passwords are saved
there, too, by the way.

134
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,207
{\an8}Uh, you always use the same one.

135
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,333
{\an8}Okay, so--

136
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,670
{\an8}So where is everyone?

137
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,463
{\an8}Aren't you two
in the same house?

138
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,008
{\an8}No, Hannah's actually
with her dad this week.

139
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,846
{\an8}So what are you
listening to exactly?

140
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,140
{\an8}[Hanna] Polish jazz.

141
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,350
{\an8}Yeah, I knew that.

142
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,102
{\an8}Yeah, during
the communist takeover,

143
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,854
{\an8}jazz was totally repressed.

144
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,898
{\an8}And when Stalin died,
a new wave began.

145
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,442
{\an8}Krzysztof Komeda? Like--

146
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,402
{\an8}Wow.

147
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,904
{\an8}Polish jazz is the bomb.

148
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,450
{\an8}My dad plays in a band that kind
of emulates the movement.

149
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,160
{\an8}It's not as good, but--

150
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,911
{\an8}[Anya] Hannah, it's really
not time for a concert.

151
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,330
{\an8}Well, it's not a concert.

152
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,457
{\an8}It's just a conversation,
but fine.

153
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,293
{\an8}I'll leave.

154
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,836
Reach out to the others,

155
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,756
and then we can start
officially, officially.

156
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,132
[Reed] Cool.

157
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,179
[phone buzzes]

158
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,393
- [video call chimes]
- [Molly] <i>Hey!</i>

159
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,686
- [Kasper] <i>Hello!</i>
- [Reed] <i>Hi!</i>

160
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,065
{\an8}It's my favorite Molly!
[vocalizes]

161
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,275
{\an8}I don't want to see that.
Put that away.

162
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,444
{\an8}Also, how many Mollys
do you even know?

163
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,279
{\an8}A lot. Like, 12.

164
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,782
{\an8}Yeah, I don't feel special.

165
00:10:56,782 --> 00:11:00,535
{\an8}- Kasper! Nice place, dude.
- Oh, thank you.

166
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,080
{\an8}Yeah, they decided
to give all the funding

167
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,581
{\an8}to foreign student housing,

168
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,167
{\an8}but I'm chill,
because I'm off campus.

169
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,877
{\an8}Okay, the dorms aren't that bad.

170
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,046
{\an8}But anyway,
I mean, how are you guys?

171
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,548
{\an8}I don't know. Just vibing.

172
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,717
{\an8}I mean, this whole thing
is so fucking weird.

173
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,386
{\an8}So what are the signs
of this thing?

174
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,012
{\an8}The-- the sweat?

175
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,723
{\an8}Feels weird to say.
Like, the bubonic plague?

176
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,601
{\an8}Well, actually,
"sweat" is much easier to say,

177
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,395
{\an8}because it's one syllable,
"bubonic" is three.

178
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,688
{\an8}Oh, come on, Molly.
You know what I mean.

179
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,857
{\an8}Actually, I don't,
because I've never experienced

180
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,442
{\an8}the bubonic plague.

181
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,277
{\an8}[scoffs] Why don't you tell us
about it, Kasper?

182
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,988
{\an8}Come on, you're--
you're from Germany, right?

183
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,032
{\an8}So, in your homeland,
isn't that the origin

184
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,159
{\an8}of all these hateful
and evil things in the world?

185
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,661
{\an8}I think that's
what Molly is getting at.

186
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,371
{\an8}What, like, the plague?

187
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,456
{\an8}Mm, no, the whole world
blames Germany for,

188
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,833
{\an8}like, every problem.
I swear to God.

189
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,168
{\an8}Where is Dr. Davis?

190
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,378
{\an8}Oh, God.

191
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,296
{\an8}She is looking so hot today.

192
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,173
{\an8}Okay, um,
she went to get coffee.

193
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,968
{\an8}Oh, coffee's super important,
by the way.

194
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,221
{\an8}Okay, wait, you guys,
there's this rumor

195
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,474
{\an8}that it, like,
started from this leak

196
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,727
{\an8}in a botched experiment
in the lab at Decker Hall.

197
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,146
{\an8}Yeah, I heard that, too.

198
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,939
{\an8}Now, I-- I'm not so sure
that's a rumor, Molly.

199
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,315
{\an8}I think that actually happened.

200
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,693
{\an8}- Really?
- [phone buzzing]

201
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,361
[Kasper] <i>I mean,
it did start somewhere, right?</i>

202
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,280
<i>A-- and if someone
did do it on purpose,</i>

203
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,451
<i>like, uh-- like it was
a deranged science major</i>

204
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,412
<i>or-- or faculty,
what would the purpose be?</i>

205
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,038
<i>Why?</i>

206
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,498
<i>I mean, I happen to think
that it was just</i>

207
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,125
<i>an honest mistake, you know?</i>

208
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,044
{\an8}I-- I-- it doesn't exactly lead
to world domination.

209
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,797
{\an8}We are all crazy.

210
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,593
{\an8}People do crazy shit sometimes.

211
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,011
{\an8}You don't even know.

212
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,387
{\an8}Oh, my God,
put your computer down.

213
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,638
{\an8}It's, like, super disorienting.

214
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,724
{\an8}- Yeah, but, guys...
- Sorry.

215
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,601
{\an8}...someone at Jasper's party
had it,

216
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,686
{\an8}which really disturbs me
because I was there,

217
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,104
{\an8}and so was Wilder.

218
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,106
{\an8}Oh, my God, no way. Who?

219
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,359
{\an8}Uh, Jessica Williams,
the art history major.

220
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,028
{\an8}Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, I know her.

221
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,529
{\an8}But, like, we're fine.

222
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,072
{\an8}Only, like,
three people have it anyway.

223
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,909
{\an8}- No, five.
- No, I heard eight.

224
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,535
{\an8}Okay, this is ridiculous.

225
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,330
{\an8}Like, the entire student body
is, like, what?

226
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,623
{\an8}800 students?

227
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,541
{\an8}So why do we all
have to quarantine

228
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,835
{\an8}and not just those,
like, six or eight people?

229
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,338
{\an8}Well, you know, they don't know
how it spreads, right?

230
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,089
{\an8}If people have touched, uh--

231
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,091
{\an8}Yeah, I've touched a lot of
people in the last week, so...

232
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,552
{\an8}Well, all of that
is under investigation, Reed.

233
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,555
{\an8}Wait, wait, wait, the Sweat
or how many people I've touched?

234
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,642
{\an8}No, but seriously,
Mara, come on.

235
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,061
{\an8}This is a question
of the individual

236
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,479
{\an8}versus the greatest good, right?

237
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,356
{\an8}So, if you want
to selfishly go out

238
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,358
{\an8}and-- and do whatever,

239
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,859
{\an8}go to a party
with your boyfriend,

240
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,946
{\an8}you could catch it
from some Hawaiian student,

241
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,656
{\an8}and then you go give it
to your barista,

242
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,616
{\an8}and they go into the city,
and they give it to whomever,

243
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,035
{\an8}and then we're all fucked,
the whole planet.

244
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,788
{\an8}But isn't that where you'd get
herd immunity?

245
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,373
{\an8}[Reed] Herd immunity?

246
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,334
{\an8}I-- I'm sorry,
are you an anti-vaxxer?

247
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,877
{\an8}No, okay, I'm just saying

248
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,463
{\an8}that sometimes you have to
make these decisions.

249
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,382
{\an8}Like, in nature, they accept

250
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,133
{\an8}that the weakest
don't always survive.

251
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,718
{\an8}You-- so, you're talking
about Darwinism?

252
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,679
{\an8}I'm sorry, but we're at a tiny
liberal arts school.

253
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,889
{\an8}What is your point?

254
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,599
{\an8}Okay, I'm just playing
devil's advocate.

255
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,602
{\an8}Like, if we were to go out,
people would survive.

256
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,939
{\an8}Like, humanity would survive.

257
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,941
{\an8}I heard that when you get it...

258
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,945
{\an8}it drips into your sinus system,
and it can make you go blind.

259
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,488
{\an8}Your eyes get all milky

260
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,532
{\an8}- like some old dog.
- What?

261
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,576
{\an8}Yeah, dude.

262
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,035
{\an8}- Think about it, Mara.
- Stop it.

263
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,704
{\an8}Your beautiful blue eyes
will get all foamy

264
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,497
{\an8}<i>-like a cappuccino.</i>
- [phone buzzing]

265
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,207
[Mara] <i>No,
you're just making that up.</i>

266
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,458
<i>It's not funny.</i>

267
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,544
[Reed] <i>It also fucks
with your, uh,</i>

268
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,920
<i>I don't know if I can say
this in front of--</i>

269
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,005
[Molly] ...anyways,
so, thank you.

270
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,381
{\an8}All right, guys, all right.

271
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,342
{\an8}Who are we still missing?

272
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,511
Um, Parker, Selena.

273
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,224
All right, so what do you think?
Two more minutes?

274
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,934
<i>[Reed] And Wilder.</i>

275
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,312
<i>[Mara] Yeah, he'll be here
soon.</i>

276
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,149
Molly, Molly, bo-bally, banana,
tana, poppoly, me, my, mo Molly.

277
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,651
{\an8}- Where's Hillary?
- She went home.

278
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,613
{\an8}- Fuck. To the city?
- Yeah.

279
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,448
{\an8}She didn't want
to be holed up here any longer

280
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,074
{\an8}than she had to be.

281
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,993
{\an8}I mean, you know,
she's like a real hypochondriac,

282
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,247
{\an8}plus her dad's not really
doing well.

283
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,541
{\an8}- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, he's really old.

284
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,586
Well, send her my love.

285
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,213
Um, who-- who is Hillary?

286
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,424
Hillary is Molly's girlfriend.

287
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,301
She was the TA
in my early Greek seminar.

288
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,219
I tried to fuck her,
but she's gay.

289
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,138
Well, actually, she's bi.

290
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,099
She just wasn't into you, so...

291
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,643
- She told me that...
- That's just not true.

292
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,894
...multiple times.

293
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,898
I'm [indistinct] you know,
actually. [indistinct].

294
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,192
- [computer chimes]
- Hello!

295
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,693
Hey, Selena.

296
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Davis.

297
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,864
I had to go
to the clinic this morning.

298
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,367
I, um, I thought
I had the Sweat.

299
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,701
{\an8}Oh, my God, really?

300
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,371
{\an8}- [Selena] Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

301
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,831
{\an8}I went for a run.

302
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,167
{\an8}- What's up?
- How was that for you?

303
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,087
{\an8}Well, no one's out,
and my endorphins are flowing,

304
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,797
{\an8}so I feel really good.

305
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,466
{\an8}Last night,
I threw my own personal rave.

306
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,593
Oh, I did the same thing, too.

307
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,887
I pretended
I was in a club in Berlin

308
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,514
- with all the lights.
- Exactly.

309
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,850
- But I wasn't in Berlin.
- Okay, Parker, thank you.

310
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,770
Can you--
can you take a seat and join us?

311
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,606
{\an8}- [computer chimes]
- Hey. Sorry.

312
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,109
- [computer chimes]
- [synthetic voice] <i>Recording.</i>

313
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,985
Okay, let's start.

314
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,862
Sorry, can I just say one thing?

315
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,823
I-- It's relevant, I promise.

316
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,575
[laughing] No.

317
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,578
{\an8}I sold <i>Lucinda and the Argonauts</i>

318
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,288
{\an8}to Fox Pictures.

319
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,332
I'm so excited.
I can't believe it.

320
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,502
{\an8}- [Parker] That's amazing.
- It is so popular in Germany.

321
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,545
{\an8}What's that?

322
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,380
{\an8}A-- a young adult novel.

323
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,006
{\an8}- [Anya] Congratulations, Selena.
- Okay.

324
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,633
{\an8}Thank you.

325
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,512
{\an8}But we need
<i>Lucinda and the Argonauts?</i>

326
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,848
{\an8}Come on, Molly.

327
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,307
{\an8}I just don't really know

328
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,559
{\an8}what this has to do
with philosophy.

329
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,311
{\an8}Oh, but it has, like,
everything to do

330
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,439
{\an8}- with philosophy.
- Okay.

331
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,524
Anyway, Lucinda is faced

332
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,360
with so many
fight-or-flight situations.

333
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,530
You know, monsters, saboteurs,

334
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,742
the natural elements,
all working against her.

335
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,411
There is a big fight on the sea,

336
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,538
so you don't know
if she's gonna make it or not.

337
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,416
And then, over the course
of 300 or so odd pages,

338
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,169
you realize
that she's superhuman.

339
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,337
{\an8}[doorbell chimes]

340
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,674
{\an8}- [Molly] Oh, I...
- [Parker] Nice, Molly.

341
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,384
{\an8}...did not mean
to send that to everybody.

342
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,887
{\an8}[Parker] Okay, wait.
You kind of may have a point.

343
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,681
[indistinct] it feels medieval.

344
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,516
Like, maybe we're going back
to the biblical plagues

345
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,101
of the Greeks and Romans.

346
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,395
You know,
Nietzsche was a classicist.

347
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,106
{\an8}- [clears throat]
- Really?

348
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:49,152
Yeah, he was. Yeah, actually.
Parker, thank you.

349
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,029
And Selena, thank you.

350
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,655
I, um, I--

351
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,284
I wanted to start
today's seminar by taking a look

352
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,787
at Nietzsche's roots
to classicism,

353
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,581
which, of course, is covered
in this week's reading.

354
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,334
So, if we go back
to Greek mythology,

355
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:08,046
what we have here is--
is a kind of storytelling,

356
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,882
a way of transcribing
the human experience

357
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,425
in a way that I think
Nietzsche has felt

358
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,427
that we have strayed from

359
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:19,307
or, um, lost contact with.

360
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,725
So, what I'm talking about...

361
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,311
is a storytelling.

362
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,438
Mythology is a storytelling

363
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,858
that sort of encompasses
the carnal,

364
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,944
the animal, the spiritual,

365
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,655
the intellectual, even madness,

366
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,949
all of these elements
of the human experience

367
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,575
come together.

368
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,704
And then also, um,
this-- this idea of...

369
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,582
destiny and fate being, um,

370
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,836
being based on one's type
or one's character.

371
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,754
As Plato says, uh,

372
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,465
character is destiny.

373
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,343
But so what you have

374
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,555
with the rational philosophers

375
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,266
who have completely strayed
from this type of...

376
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,143
of storytelling,
what we have with them

377
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,939
is more of a-- a--
a-- a doctrinization

378
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,317
and a-- a rationalization,

379
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,236
a separation

380
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,030
of all of these elements, uh...

381
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:21,911
in a way that I think
Nietzsche finds...

382
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,789
much less complex, you know?

383
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,958
Uh, this--

384
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,211
this experience of living,
you know,

385
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,923
the Leibniz philosophy, Kasper.

386
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,675
{\an8}Yeah, philosophy of life.

387
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,136
{\an8}Kierkegaard was also
implicated in this.

388
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,013
{\an8}- Schopenhauer, too, actually.
- [Anya] Right.

389
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,306
So now look, I mean...

390
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,934
Nietzsche's a philosopher
who is-- He's-- he's--

391
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,895
he's very difficult to explore

392
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,272
in a session like this.

393
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,773
I mean, we could spend
forever really--

394
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,026
{\an8}Sorry, can we just go back
to this idea

395
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,612
{\an8}of fate and destiny
being based on your type

396
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,572
{\an8}- or your character?
- [Anya] Yeah, yeah.

397
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,367
{\an8}Okay, so character is destiny,

398
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,535
{\an8}as Plato says,

399
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,954
{\an8}but what about circumstance

400
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,873
{\an8}and chance shaping your destiny?

401
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,585
{\an8}I mean, I was raised
by two women, two moms, okay?

402
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,879
And, you know,
they lived in, like,

403
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,589
a completely separate reality.

404
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,092
They were cool and progressive,
you know, sure,

405
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,595
but they are incredibly
brilliant, both of them,

406
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,182
and they essentially forced me
to come here.

407
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,059
{\an8}I mean,
I didn't even really know

408
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,270
{\an8}if I wanted to pursue college,
higher education in general,

409
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,607
{\an8}but they wanted
a higher existence for me,

410
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,818
{\an8}- so now I'm here.
- Because that's what you wanted.

411
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,029
{\an8}Well, no, even if I want this,
I want that,

412
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,366
{\an8}I'm still living
their trajectory for me

413
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,533
{\an8}by getting a degree.

414
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,455
Yes, Molly.

415
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,625
Before we get into this,
I-- I-- I think it's crucial

416
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,377
that in-- in order to understand

417
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,921
these somewhat
controversial ideas here

418
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,674
that we really need to, um,

419
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,301
we really need to know
about the 19th century

420
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,761
in terms of the historical,

421
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,472
political, philosophical climate

422
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,767
in which Nietzsche emerged.

423
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,644
{\an8}So, look,
the 19th century can-- can--

424
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,105
{\an8}can really be separated
into two very distinct parts.

425
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:16,442
{\an8}We have before 1848, 1850,
and after.

426
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,194
Can anyone speak to me

427
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,614
about what is happening
in Europe

428
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,950
at this time?

429
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,576
Well, the revolutions of 1848...

430
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,703
[Wilder] Sorry,
it's just, like...

431
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,829
...are some of the largest--

432
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,497
...kind of sounds like

433
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,374
we're just kind of reading
from an encyclopedia.

434
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,543
{\an8}Sorry?

435
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,461
{\an8}[Wilder] No, it's just
not very challenging.

436
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,380
{\an8}I mean, this seminar, right,

437
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,923
{\an8}this whole class is supposed
to be a challenging discussion,

438
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,468
{\an8}supposed to move things forward,
I just...

439
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,429
{\an8}I'm not really challenged.

440
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,807
{\an8}We just started the discussion,
like, a few minutes ago, um--

441
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,894
{\an8}I know, but challenge me,
or I'll challenge you.

442
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,229
{\an8}So, uh...

443
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,191
{\an8}so what we see happening here

444
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,152
{\an8}in the middle
of the 19th century is this,

445
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,946
{\an8}like, major reconstruction

446
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,074
{\an8}or reconstitution
of liberal values

447
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,242
{\an8}with the restitution

448
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,828
{\an8}of the Bourbon monarchy
in France

449
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,081
{\an8}and with the apotheosis
of Bismarck in Germany.

450
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,916
{\an8}So, these two events, in a way,

451
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,335
{\an8}sort of denied
all of this progress

452
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,588
{\an8}that the revolutions in--
in France

453
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,924
{\an8}and in America had made
in the previous century.

454
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,218
{\an8}Um, up to this point,

455
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,721
{\an8}history and politics

456
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,348
{\an8}and art and philosophy

457
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,684
{\an8}were all sort of converging

458
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,021
{\an8}and building unilaterally,

459
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,066
{\an8}cohesively, on top
of one another

460
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,527
{\an8}towards this notion of progress.

461
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,197
{\an8}Um, but now, all of a sudden,

462
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:47,450
{\an8}there's this sort of
terrifying reversal.

463
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,203
{\an8}And-- and you know,
this-- this of course,

464
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,205
{\an8}really, um,

465
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,415
{\an8}throws things on their head.

466
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,752
{\an8}So, a large sense
of-- of nihilism looms.

467
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,379
{\an8}Um, and what we have now
with Nietzsche

468
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,633
{\an8}and his contemporaries

469
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,928
{\an8}are, um-- Or let's look
at these artists.

470
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,429
{\an8}So, the-- the--

471
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,515
{\an8}the celebrated artists
of the time

472
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,309
{\an8}are Van Gogh, Monet, Manet.

473
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,228
Uh, what you're looking at here

474
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,563
is the emergence
of an avant-garde

475
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,981
for the first time, you know?

476
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,860
Uh, you have a, uh,
an avant-garde class,

477
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,405
a rejection of institutions,
of religions, of--

478
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,990
The, uh, the-- the rejects,
the Salon des Refusés.

479
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,575
[Anya] Right. That's right.

480
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,870
{\an8}These people become the stars
of the moment.

481
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,122
Nietzsche...

482
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,625
is re-evaluating

483
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,586
our whole philosophical
tradition, in a sense.

484
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,507
There is no longer any sort of
pan-universal set of truths

485
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,510
for which we could all sort of
ascribe meaning.

486
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,220
{\an8}Um, it's the individual

487
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,514
{\an8}that must search
for the salvation.

488
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,016
{\an8}So, who
and what does he introduce

489
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,729
{\an8}to express
this ultimate aspiration?

490
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,691
- Anyone?
- He introduces the Ubermensch.

491
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,320
Okay, Mara, okay.
So, let's unpack that.

492
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,822
{\an8}Well, through Ubermensch,

493
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,740
{\an8}Nietzsche introduces

494
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,034
{\an8}the idea of a superior man,

495
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:16,080
{\an8}who can rise above conventional
Christian morality

496
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,250
{\an8}to create and impose
his own set of values.

497
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,960
{\an8}Well, that's just bullshit

498
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,254
{\an8}because what you're describing
is patriarchy.

499
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,382
{\an8}Not patriarchy. Hierarchy.

500
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,759
{\an8}And hierarchy should,
and does, exist.

501
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,429
{\an8}I mean,
even in this class, right?

502
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,601
{\an8}Yeah, there's a hierarchy
created by who will progress

503
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,603
{\an8}and excel in this environment.

504
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,688
{\an8}You know, who will get an A
at the end of the semester.

505
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:41,814
{\an8}[Wilder] Exactly, Mara.

506
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,566
{\an8}And I feel like it's, uh,

507
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,693
{\an8}the most important part of
that is to consider

508
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,071
{\an8}what happens if society
or this class

509
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,742
{\an8}or structure accepts
the Ubermensch, right?

510
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,579
{\an8}The Ubermensch may harm others,
may overtake others.

511
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,582
{\an8}Therefore, one adheres
to suffering,

512
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,959
{\an8}accepting the earth,
but aiming to be above it,

513
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,128
{\an8}to be above mankind.

514
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,963
You're really cute.
Are you dating?

515
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,841
Isn't that one of the theories
Hitler used

516
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,259
to define the Holocaust?

517
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,221
{\an8}Creating and perfecting
the master race, yeah.

518
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,056
{\an8}Uh, I--
I do want to state, though,

519
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,266
{\an8}before we kind of delve
into that,

520
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,851
{\an8}that-- that-- that--

521
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,895
{\an8}that it was through
misinterpretation, of course,

522
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:24,565
{\an8}that Hitler and others were able
to exploit Nietzschean--

523
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,942
The Lebensborn program.

524
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,320
- The what?
- His <i>Das Lebensborn-Programm.</i>

525
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,324
The Lebensborn program
was created by Hitler to, um,

526
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,577
in a sense, spring to life
the master race, right?

527
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:40,790
So basically, he created
breeding facilities

528
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,501
where Aryan women
were recruited,

529
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,586
uh, to be impregnated

530
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,463
by genetically pure SS officers.

531
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,966
{\an8}42,000.

532
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,802
{\an8}There were 42,000 babies

533
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,220
{\an8}produced during that time.

534
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,721
{\an8}Yeah, my grandfather
was one of them.

535
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,139
{\an8}He-- he was born
from the program.

536
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,557
{\an8}Really? That is fascinating.

537
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,311
So this--
this Sweat, right, this--

538
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,522
this illness
that's going around campus,

539
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,983
could just be, like,
some kind of mindset.

540
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,526
Like some kind of

541
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,487
psychological
or sociological experiment.

542
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,156
I mean, not even real.

543
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,284
Yeah, I mean,
I have thought this all along,

544
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,952
you know?

545
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,662
So, one person is so convinced
that they have it,

546
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,122
then it spreads
to another person

547
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,832
who also feigns illness,

548
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,917
and eventually,
we all have it, right?

549
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,919
Or we think we do,
and then we succumb

550
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,547
to some kind of, like,
widespread hysteria.

551
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,590
{\an8}Well, okay, Selena, I guess if--

552
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,843
{\an8}if we're going to
switch gears here,

553
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,553
{\an8}if we were to view this moment

554
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,930
{\an8}through a Nietzschean lens,
we might...

555
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,851
{\an8}see it as mass hysteria or--

556
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:46,022
{\an8}or conformity of sorts
of the weaker man,

557
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,190
{\an8}- the weaker spirit.
- [Wilder] Yes, yes.

558
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,360
{\an8}But I still feel like
that's missing something.

559
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,739
{\an8}I mean, it's-- it is a theory
about power and control,

560
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,450
{\an8}the masses,
the conformity of the herd, yes.

561
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,579
{\an8}But you're missing
that if we become above man,

562
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,832
{\an8}if we become the Uberman,
then we can't get sick.

563
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,584
{\an8}I mean, not in that way.

564
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,004
{\an8}I thought suffering
was elevated in the Ubermensch.

565
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,173
{\an8}Uh, uh, it is, it is.

566
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,717
{\an8}So, I'm not sure I'm--
I-- I'm not sure I'm following

567
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,635
{\an8}or agreeing
with your point, Wilder.

568
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,387
{\an8}Can we go back for a second?

569
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,182
{\an8}Nietzsche denounced God, right?
Like, threw him out?

570
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,809
{\an8}Well, you know, this idea
of throwing off religion

571
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,812
{\an8}is kind of a sort of part
of the moral nihilism

572
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,439
{\an8}of Nietzschean philosophy.

573
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,442
{\an8}So, really, if you're a follower
of anything of--

574
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,528
{\an8}of an institution,
of a religion, of whatever,

575
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,906
{\an8}you're hoarding
your individualism.

576
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,202
{\an8}Okay, but he also claimed
there was a crisis of nihilism.

577
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,578
{\an8}He didn't throw God away.

578
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,829
{\an8}He admitted
that the death of God

579
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,623
{\an8}would profoundly disrupt
society.

580
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,043
{\an8}Remember, religion at this time
was the construct

581
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,544
{\an8}through which individuals
organized

582
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,171
{\an8}their sense of the world.

583
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,799
{\an8}Therefore, the loss of God
was a loss of coherence,

584
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,550
{\an8}- a loss of objective truth.
- [Anya] Yeah. Yes.

585
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,136
God, I forgot
how smart you are, Parker.

586
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:00,554
Um, who here believes in God?

587
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,932
Reed, we're not going to do
a poll

588
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,642
on people's religious beliefs.

589
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:07,144
I feel like it's valuable
to the discussion.

590
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,646
{\an8}Uh, Wilder,

591
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,398
{\an8}- what about you, man?
- What?

592
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,609
{\an8}- Do you believe in God?
- No.

593
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,319
{\an8}So you're an agnostic?

594
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,905
{\an8}- I'm an atheist.
- Whatever, same difference.

595
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,573
{\an8}Actually, they're not similar
at all.

596
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,033
You don't believe in God.
We got it.

597
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,868
Mara, what about you?
Do you believe in God?

598
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,080
I-- I have a feeling
that might affect your coupling.

599
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,165
Are we really doing this?

600
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,501
Why are you so interested
in our relationship?

601
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,128
Good question.

602
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,505
{\an8}[Anya] Um...

603
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,048
{\an8}Mara does not believe in God.

604
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,591
{\an8}...okay, look--

605
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,593
{\an8}- I'm right here.
- Okay, all right, cool.

606
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,554
While I do think
that personal beliefs

607
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,681
can be relevant
to our discussions,

608
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,307
I'm-- I'm-- I'm really not sure

609
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,976
why it's coming up
right here, Reed.

610
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,645
{\an8}But Anya, you yourself
always talk about

611
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,896
{\an8}how you're from Pittsburgh,

612
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,857
{\an8}how that's shaped
your personal views,

613
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,483
{\an8}how you move through the world.

614
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,860
{\an8}I mean, shouldn't we be doing
the same thing?

615
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,653
{\an8}How did we get to Pittsburgh?

616
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,238
{\an8}Yeah, I didn't know that.

617
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,907
{\an8}When did she mention
being from Pittsburgh?

618
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,659
{\an8}Where's Pittsburgh?

619
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,830
{\an8}Look, I-- it's possible
that I have mentioned things

620
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,457
{\an8}in previous classes.

621
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:13,294
The point is
is that no one has to adhere

622
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:16,213
to any of these theories,
obviously, in order to study--

623
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,383
Wait, okay,
so I was raised Catholic, right?

624
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,801
I, like,
went to a Catholic high school.

625
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,428
Okay, can we--

626
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,096
No, wait, Dr. Davis, I--

627
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,015
I promise I'm gonna
make my point really quick,

628
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,641
- and it's relevant.
- [Anya] All right.

629
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,436
Like, all that we were
talking about earlier, right?

630
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,730
How you're bringing influences
to your being,

631
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,566
or you wanting to be like them,
or whatever.

632
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,152
But, see, as I grew up,

633
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,988
I made the decision
not to be Catholic anymore.

634
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,615
Can you-- Selena,

635
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,867
can you please stop
co-opting the class,

636
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,577
just to interrupt Dr. Davis

637
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,787
and say something
completely irrelevant?

638
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:53,459
{\an8}What Selena is saying
is not completely unrelated.

639
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,547
{\an8}Let's take a second here.

640
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,593
{\an8}I-- it is clear that people pray
to a higher spiritual being,

641
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,720
{\an8}or a god, or institution,

642
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,306
{\an8}or the like, in dark times

643
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,600
{\an8}because they want something
to believe in.

644
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,228
{\an8}I mean, much like we're doing
in this class right now.

645
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,773
{\an8}Yeah, I mean,
God has stood the test of time

646
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,858
{\an8}because much of society

647
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,860
{\an8}- is entirely hopeless.
- Right.

648
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,489
{\an8}And our judgment

649
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,115
{\an8}of others is fickle.

650
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,909
{\an8}I mean, actually, Molly,
when you think about it,

651
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,745
{\an8}there is no right and wrong
when it comes to beliefs.

652
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,123
{\an8}Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

653
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,085
So you're saying Hitler,
and like, all of his beliefs,

654
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,255
attempting to exterminate
the entire Jewish population

655
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,839
was correct?

656
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,633
[Wilder] No, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

657
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,760
Or the way
the Russians decided to hide

658
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,887
<i>what actually happened
at Chernobyl</i>

659
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,056
in order to glorify
their country

660
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,933
and maintain
their politics, their beliefs.

661
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,476
That's all a-okay?

662
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,688
It's not an issue of morality,
which is the trap

663
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,190
that this conversation
keeps falling into.

664
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,818
So, if it's not an issue
of morality...

665
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,487
what is the metric
that defines this?

666
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,989
[Molly] <i>Well, I'm not--
I'm not moralizing though.</i>

667
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,156
[Wilder] <i>not morality,</i>

668
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,992
<i>- it's vitality.</i>
- That's right.

669
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,368
{\an8}The strength of character
is all.

670
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,494
- That's right.
- Yeah.

671
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,579
It's an issue of vitality.

672
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,290
And by the way, Molly, you know,

673
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,751
those are two
more obvious examples, right?

674
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,004
You know, kind of generic.

675
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,299
You can be a little more
specific is all I'm saying.

676
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,011
I'm sorry my digression offended
so many people.

677
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,514
Wow, Molly, I am so impressed

678
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,558
with you apologizing
for your behavior.

679
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,894
I am just pointing out
to you, Wilder,

680
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,521
that what you are saying,

681
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,316
despite your expertise
on all subjects all the time,

682
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,693
is not always correct.

683
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,529
Yeah, but I never said I was.

684
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,324
{\an8}Well, then it's an incredibly
calculated performance.

685
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,411
{\an8}Oh, no one's gonna back me up.

686
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,205
{\an8}Okay, cool.
That's awesome. Great.

687
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,585
{\an8}At my bar mitzvah,
my pants split

688
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,837
{\an8}during the chair dance.

689
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,213
{\an8}Oh.

690
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,591
{\an8}Never set foot
in a synagogue again.

691
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,845
{\an8}So, you gave up
the entirety of Judaism

692
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,056
{\an8}because your pants split?

693
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,600
{\an8}Well that and the whole
singing in Hebrew part.

694
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,976
{\an8}That's pretty tough.

695
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,436
{\an8}[Reed] Don't worry
about it, dude.

696
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,647
{\an8}I went to so many
bar mitzvahs when I was a kid.

697
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,190
{\an8}I technically lost
my virginity at one.

698
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,941
{\an8}I got a BJ
from this girl with braces.

699
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,944
{\an8}Oh, my God. Reed, shut up.
Shut-- Just stop talking.

700
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,906
{\an8}Nobody wants to hear
about your BJ.

701
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,616
{\an8}I mean, we were having--

702
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,534
{\an8}<i>All of you,
have you been present recently?</i>

703
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,912
{\an8}Because we were having
a very intense conversation

704
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,163
{\an8}about the Holocaust,

705
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,873
{\an8}and all you can think about

706
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,583
{\an8}<i>-is getting head?</i>
- Could-- could we just try--

707
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,834
{\an8}<i>[Molly] That's so insensitive
and disgusting!</i>

708
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,086
{\an8}Okay, Molly.

709
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,799
{\an8}What, oh, oh, I'm being
the crazy one right now?

710
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,300
No, I just--

711
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,678
I'm gonna ask us all
to just return

712
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,764
to a more respectful way
of talking to each other.

713
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,016
{\an8}Well, it's not my fault
that Reed loves to just listen

714
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,310
{\an8}to the sound of his own voice.

715
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,063
What's wrong with listening
to the sound of my own voice?

716
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,981
Your voice tells you a lot
about your being.

717
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,150
The Upanishads actually came up
with a lot of their philosophies

718
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,527
based on questions
about the origins of the voice.

719
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,070
[Molly] Stop and listen
to Dr. Davis

720
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,196
and stop being so disrespectful.

721
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,656
[Anya] I'd like to end this now.

722
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,408
[Molly] <i>Shut up! Oh, my God.</i>

723
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:13,784
<i>I can't even
handle this anymore, bye!</i>

724
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,411
- [Wilder] <i>Reed?</i>
- [Anya sighs]

725
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,204
<i>Reed, can I, uh,
can I tell you something?</i>

726
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,623
- [Reed] <i>I'd be honored.</i>
- Wilder.

727
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,251
{\an8}You're an idiotic representation
of your generation.

728
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,128
{\an8}A pig.

729
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,213
{\an8}You're a pig grappling through
the vines of intelligentsia,

730
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,881
{\an8}plotting against
our prolonged thought

731
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,508
{\an8}trying to move things forward,

732
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,177
{\an8}and then chewing our ideas
with your slime.

733
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,513
{\an8}- You're just--
- Uh, okay.

734
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:35,973
Let's take ten.

735
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,559
[computer chiming]

736
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,478
[laughs]

737
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,192
[sighs]

738
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,322
Dr. Davis, we are missing
significant information

739
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,158
pertaining
to what actually happened

740
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,285
during the rest of the class
and the lead-up to the jump.

741
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,996
We've been in contact
with everyone involved.

742
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,539
We have testimonies

743
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,040
from your students
and your daughter.

744
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,460
You've been in contact
with my daughter?

745
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,380
We're just asking questions.

746
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,591
We've had to question
everyone involved.

747
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,926
So that's why he's here?

748
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,264
Professor Keating's the head
of the Standards Committee.

749
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,390
[Anya] Uh-huh.

750
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,143
Right.

751
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,395
So then he told you
we were fucking?

752
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,232
No, I hadn't.

753
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:30,527
And that I had called him
during the break in the class?

754
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,155
- So it's my fault now?
- Fault? No.

755
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,157
I mean, I just-- I assumed
that's why you were here.

756
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,451
[Dean Johnson] Is this true?

757
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,749
[Cole] Yes,
she called me that day.

758
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,210
That's not what I'm asking you.

759
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,711
I'm asking you
if you were in a relationship

760
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,129
with her.

761
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,548
I don't see why that matters.

762
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,091
[Dean Johnson]
Because you're the head

763
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,468
of the Standards Committee,
Cole.

764
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,847
[Joanna] What exactly
did she tell you, Mr. Keating,

765
00:34:58,847 --> 00:34:59,973
on that phone call?

766
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,603
{\an8}- It's good to see you.
- Like, it's been that long?

767
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,188
{\an8}It's been like five days.

768
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,566
{\an8}Well, uh, yeah, but I mean,

769
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,693
{\an8}feels like longer.

770
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,362
{\an8}A lot has happened.

771
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,656
{\an8}Like before the world
set on fire. [chuckling]

772
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,994
{\an8}- Can you come over tonight?
- Yeah.

773
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,623
{\an8}Uh, I got to finish this outline
for this grant application.

774
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,500
{\an8}My Diderot research.

775
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,172
{\an8}Um, are you okay?

776
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,343
{\an8}[sighs]

777
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,557
{\an8}Yeah, it's just
my seminar just got so crazy.

778
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:42,850
{\an8}Which one was that?

779
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,521
{\an8}Just like my only one,
the one with Wilder Hewitt.

780
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,897
{\an8}Oh, what's up with him?

781
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,566
{\an8}I thought you liked him.

782
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,777
{\an8}I do like him, it's just...

783
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,655
{\an8}he's just very volatile today.

784
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:03,662
{\an8}So, uh, students, like,

785
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,289
{\an8}so a lot of his kind, you know,

786
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,957
{\an8}any of his type...

787
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,960
{\an8}they can totally have

788
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,128
{\an8}their heads stuck
up their own asses.

789
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,921
{\an8}You know what I mean?

790
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,172
{\an8}They think they know
everything about everything,

791
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,217
{\an8}and you can't teach them.

792
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,721
{\an8}But you can influence them.

793
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,683
And, you know, it's--

794
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,686
Often it's the most difficult
ones that teach us the most.

795
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:32,691
She said the class was hard
and that she felt overwhelmed.

796
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,159
Why didn't you tell us this?

797
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,288
[Cole] I-- It didn't seem
like it was important.

798
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,792
You didn't think
it was important?

799
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,254
It was a conversation
with an academic colleague.

800
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,798
[Dean Johnson] Mm-hmm.

801
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,176
Okay, Cole,
I think you should go.

802
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:13,398
Is there anything else
that you'd like to tell us?

803
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,532
It seemed like
she was drawn to him.

804
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,618
[Dean Johnson]
Drawn to him in what way?

805
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,418
In the way that a teacher
is drawn to a bright student.

806
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,979
[Joanna] What did you talk about
with Wilder?

807
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:56,900
Many things.

808
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,237
We-- we spoke often.

809
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:05,242
It seemed very much
part of his process.

810
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,161
It's-- it's normal,
it's standard

811
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:09,997
that I speak with my students.

812
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,583
What-- what is it
that you think I know?

813
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,335
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

814
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,962
I'm not jumping to conclusions.

815
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,047
I'm just--
I'm simply asking questions.

816
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,509
I teach philosophy.
It's the nature of what I do.

817
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:29,099
December 2nd, 2009.
Does that date ring a bell?

818
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,561
No.

819
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,104
[Joanna]
There was a custody hearing.

820
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,231
Your daughter
was five years old, correct?

821
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,609
[sighs] Yes.

822
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,696
During the hearing,
your ex-husband, Phil Archer,

823
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,489
claimed that you were unable
to leave the house

824
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,158
for six weeks.

825
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,535
Yes, I was severely depressed
during my divorce.

826
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,746
That you were living
in a state of alarming disarray,

827
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,664
and according
to your daughter's testimony

828
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:53,999
during the proceedings,

829
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,959
"I saw Mommy eating.

830
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,336
Eating roots and plants
from the garden.

831
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,589
She said she wanted
to go back to the earth,

832
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,549
to the way
things were supposed to be."

833
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,471
What does this have to do
with anything?

834
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,562
Uh, well, um...

835
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,649
what strikes me
about that statement

836
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:20,692
from your daughter, Anya,

837
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,569
is that it sounds very similar

838
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,738
to some of the things
that Wilder was talking about

839
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,157
just before he jumped.

840
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,159
Relevant
to the Nietzschean theories

841
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,036
you were discussing
in that class?

842
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,040
Yeah, I just-- I'm-- I'm sorry,
I don't-- I don't understand.

843
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,668
[Joanna] Your daughter brings up
a level of instability...

844
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,921
- Oh my God, instability.
- ...which was also mentioned.

845
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,593
In December of 2014,

846
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,512
you resigned
from your last position

847
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,888
at Jones College.

848
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,057
Can you tell us about that?

849
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,392
What is going on here?

850
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,938
A student flung himself
from his window

851
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,273
- during your class, Anya.
- I know!

852
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,359
So I'm sure you can understand

853
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,568
- the urgency of the matter.
- I'm sorry.

854
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,283
I'm sorry.

855
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,953
I need a minute.

856
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,292
- [low somber music plays]
- [bell tolling in the distance]

857
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,153
- [Cole] Hey.
- Hi.

858
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,445
[Cole] I've been looking
for you everywhere.

859
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,738
Sorry.

860
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,323
I'm just, uh,
really glad you came.

861
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,242
I didn't think you would.

862
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,535
Hi, Wilder.

863
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,830
Hi, Professor Keating.

864
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,878
I'm glad you two met, uh,

865
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,504
as you know, Anya,
we don't really have

866
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,673
traditional majors here,

867
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,886
but I'd say Wilder's focus
is our department.

868
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,097
Uh, where do you live?

869
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,560
Oh, uh, the housing

870
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,103
over on Ponce.

871
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,231
Why?

872
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,276
Wanted to walk you home.

873
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,571
Great.

874
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,574
I'll see you tomorrow.

875
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:33,700
I'm in your seminar.

876
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,370
Great. See you tomorrow.

877
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,334
[Cole] Interesting kid.

878
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,460
[Anya] Yeah.

879
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,633
What'd you guys talk about?

880
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,718
[Anya] Oh.

881
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,429
The bonfire.

Kasper, Vlad?

00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,442
Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, Vlad.

885
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,903
- Seriously?
- Oh, Vlad!

886
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,780
[Vlad] Hey, hey! Parker!

887
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,824
- What's up, man?
- [computer chiming]

888
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,409
Oh, bye, Vlad.

889
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,744
Molly, how are you doing?

890
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,871
I know that was
a little tense before.

891
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,623
{\an8}So sorry I got so upset,
you guys.

we're going to Bubby's, okay?

00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,486
{\an8}As soon as this is done,
the day this is fucking over.

904
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,656
Oh. Has anyone heard

905
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,534
about Dr. Davis and Dr. Keaton?

906
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,286
[Molly] No, why?

907
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,456
I saw them getting drinks
at Bubby's the other day.

908
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,959
[Molly] Yeah, okay, but maybe
they like their happy hour.

909
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,585
I mean, I sure do.

910
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,129
{\an8}[Reed] Yeah, me too.

911
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:11,798

It could be routine.

{\an8}Maybe, yeah, maybe, I--
I saw them not once, though,

913
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,305
{\an8}not twice, three times,
and last week.

914
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,307
{\an8}Gossip!

915
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,891
{\an8}You think they're fucking, bro?

916
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,393
{\an8}I don't think
they're grading papers.

917
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,979
{\an8}- Hello.
- [Reed] Hey, Wilder.

918
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,439
{\an8}Hi.

919
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,940
That was really
emotional before,

920
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,777
and I just want
to discuss our feelings.

921
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:34,696
You know,
you kind of attacked me there

922
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,531
with that poetic gibberish

923
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,783
that sounded like it was
from <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

924
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,536
Okay, they speak English
in <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

925
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,289
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.

926
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,709
[sighs]

927
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,717
{\an8}- [clears throat]
- [computer chimes]

928
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,969
{\an8}Okay, guys, so we're back.

929
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,347
{\an8}Uh, I wanted to start
this next half

930
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:04,142
{\an8}by just grounding us
in some text.

931
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,143
{\an8}Really?

932
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,978
{\an8}All right, guys, look, I, uh--

933
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,273
{\an8}I know you don't want
to acknowledge

934
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,900
{\an8}that there's any kind of
hierarchy here,

935
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,193
{\an8}but I am your professor.

936
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,403
{\an8}I am trying to lead you
in a discussion.

937
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,365
{\an8}[Reed] I don't believe
in hierarchy.

938
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:21,451
{\an8}Oh, wow, Reed, that might be
the first thing

939
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,869
{\an8}you and I actually agree on.

940
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,873
Uh, your question
of my authority

941
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,501
or hierarchy
in this context is what?

942
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,294
Is directed at academia?

943
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,339
Yes, I mean, the institution.

944
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,259
And you bringing it up,
you yourself are questioning it.

945
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,596
You know, Reed, yes,
he's being an asshole dickhead,

946
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,265
but he still has
the authority to question you

947
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,309
just like you have
the authority to question him.

948
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,354
I mean, Plato, Socrates,
that was like the first

949
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,189
student-teacher
relationship, right?

950
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,233
But look at where
hierarchy has gotten us.

951
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:56,945
We live in a completely
patriarchal, racist society.

952
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,655
This isn't a philosophy,
it's gender studies.

953
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,949
Oh, well, thank you
for bringing up my minor.

954
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,494
Also, I hate it when
any time a woman loves to talk

955
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,579
about patriarchy or equality,

956
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,123
a man has to
question it and be like,

957
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,125
"Oh, do you know
gender studies?"

958
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,751
It's, like, so frustrating.

959
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,545
All this
male versus female bullshit.

960
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,463
I mean, God,
we've been dealing with it

961
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,507
since the beginning
of fucking time.

962
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,467
We are still dealing with it.

963
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,429
Ah, I mean, for example, okay,
at the beginning of this class,

964
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,389
Parker brought up
the fact that you are

965
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,599
in a sexual relationship
with Dr. Keaton.

966
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,809
{\an8}[Parker] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, Molly!

967
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,936
What? You did.

968
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,273
And just by the way,
if you were a man,

969
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,859
do you think anybody would be
saying something like that?

970
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:37,777
{\an8}[sighs]

971
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,739
{\an8}Right, um...

972
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,119
{\an8}I, uh--

973
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:50,707
{\an8}I'm gonna disregard
that last statement

974
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:55,628
{\an8}that you made, Molly, about my
personal life, and I am--

975
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,839
{\an8}I'm just gonna read
the text now.

976
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,260
Uh, this is
from <i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i>

977
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,890
"What inspires
respect for women,

978
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,017
and often enough even fear,

979
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,811
is her nature, which is
more natural than man's.

980
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:15,315
The genuine, cunning, suppleness

981
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:16,774
of a beast of prey.

982
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,403
The tiger's claw
under the glove.

983
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,490
Her inner wildness."

984
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:29,621
Men oppress women,
because they know

985
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,623
they're a force
to be reckoned with.

986
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:35,502
{\an8}Well, Nietzsche also claims
that the emancipation of women

987
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:38,630
{\an8}from feminism is merely just a--

988
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,840
{\an8}I mean, kind of a resentment

989
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,675
{\an8}of some women
against other women

990
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,595
{\an8}because they're better
physically constituted

991
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,514
{\an8}and more able to bear children.

992
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:51,226
It sounds like a little bit
of a compliment from Nietzsche,

993
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:54,270
layered with this
bit of misogyny, no?

994
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:57,398
No, exactly,
Kasper, because literally,

995
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,693
any time a woman is
competing against another woman,

996
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,403
it's inherently misogynist,

997
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,364
because it's
for the benefit of a man.

998
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,575
That's, like, the first thing
I've heard in this class

999
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,826
that makes sense.

1000
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,247
Look, <i>Lucinda and the Argonauts</i>
is a great example

1001
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:13,998
of a text
that actively engages with--

1002
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,043
- Are you serious?
- No, no, no!

1003
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,712
We are still questioning
if men are the greater sex,

1004
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,422
and that's insane!

1005
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,508
Right, but that's
because they are, I mean--

1006
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:27,428
{\an8}In Nietzsche's theory, right,

1007
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,641
{\an8}a woman's whole purpose--
Her whole purpose, her goal,

1008
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,602
{\an8}is to give birth
to an Ubermensch.

1009
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,229
{\an8}Which is just a theory.

1010
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,398
{\an8}Right, but her
ability to do that

1011
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,942
{\an8}dictates her relationship
to man.

1012
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,902
{\an8}Nietzsche talks
about the Ubermensch

1013
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,197
{\an8}that literally translates
to "superman."

1014
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,826
Okay, so, Wilder,

1015
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:54,122
you're actually
interpreting it literally.

1016
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,499
You know, Wilder,

1017
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,919
I think that
that interpretation is valid.

1018
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,172
{\an8}Okay, thank you, yes,
more than valid, but--

1019
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,217
- So you're agreeing with him?
- No, I'm not, I'm just--

1020
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,011
I'm saying
that it's interesting,

1021
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,887
and that I'm acknowledging it.

1022
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,391
Look, it's impossible
to talk about Nietzsche

1023
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,728
and-- and sort of
skip over misogyny.

1024
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,688
It's-- it's in his writings.

1025
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:23,026
{\an8}But wouldn't it be interesting
to think of misogyny

1026
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:26,571
{\an8}as a part of, perhaps,
an overall strategy...

1027
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:30,700
{\an8}of Nietzsche's to demonstrate
that our attitude

1028
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,829
{\an8}towards gender and sex
is completely cultural?

1029
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,873
{\an8}And it's often incredibly
destructive

1030
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,459
{\an8}to our-- our potential
as individuals

1031
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:43,171
{\an8}and as a species, and...

1032
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:47,050
{\an8}perhaps it's something
to be overcome.

1033
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,179
{\an8}It's an interesting, I mean,
glorified, positive reading.

1034
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,472
{\an8}But it's all besides the point,

1035
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:53,765
{\an8}because when it
comes down to it,

1036
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,433
{\an8}men did come first.

1037
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,644
{\an8}And were created first.

1038
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,562
According to the Bible?

1039
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,105
- Yeah, which is--
- So we're interpreting

1040
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,857
the Bible literally?

1041
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,069
Yeah, it's a source
of mythological creation.

1042
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:08,279
{\an8}Okay, but we've seen
in this class, right,

1043
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,406
{\an8}mythology, philosophy,
and it's also--

1044
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,367
{\an8}There's plenty
of scientific evidence

1045
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,910
{\an8}that backs this up.

1046
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,037
Okay, Nietzsche had very
controversial views on this.

1047
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,288
Next text.

1048
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,875
"From the beginning,

1049
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,878
nothing has been
more alien, repugnant,

1050
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:28,508
or hostile to woman than truth.

1051
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,259
Her great art is the lie

1052
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,930
and highest concern
is mere appearance and beauty."

1053
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:37,850
Oh, Selena,
the prime example of that.

1054
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,977
{\an8}- Wilder.
- Excuse me, I'm sorry?

1055
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,564
{\an8}Well, no, it's just,
you obviously

1056
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,692
{\an8}put a lot of effort
into your appearance

1057
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:48,403
{\an8}just to come onto this
online class.

1058
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,612
{\an8}You know what I mean?

1059
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:52,156
{\an8}- Easy, Wilder.
- Oh, my God.

1060
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:55,243
{\an8}That is just offensive.

1061
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,537
{\an8}It's not offensive,
it's just an observation.

1062
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:59,038
{\an8}No, no, no, no, no, no.

1063
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,124
{\an8}This whole fucking seminar
is offensive.

1064
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,584
{\an8}Yeah, this whole seminar
is offensive.

1065
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,545
{\an8}It's fucking biased,

1066
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:09,298
{\an8}and set in a bunch
of made-up beliefs!

1067
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,426
{\an8}- None of you--
- [Reed] Selena!

1068
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:13,010
{\an8}- None of you...
- Selena!

1069
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,054
{\an8}...can even comprehend
or understand the fact

1070
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,849
{\an8}that I might actually
have a brain.

1071
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,977
{\an8}- Yeah, and that I--
- Stop, stop, stop!

1072
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,520
{\an8}I-- I--

1073
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,523
{\an8}There's something wrong
with your eyes.

1074
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,275
{\an8}What? What is it?

1075
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,361
{\an8}[gasps] Oh, my God.

1076
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,614
Oh, my God, you guys,

1077
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,533
help me, tell me what to do.

1078
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,910
Help me! Tell me what to do.

1079
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,579
Wash out your eyes
with water and--

1080
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,123
I have to go.
I have to go, just--

1081
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,584
Where did she go?

1082
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,377
Maybe someone
should go check on her?

1083
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,045
[Parker] Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm on it, all right.

1084
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,714
Reed, the eye thing,

1085
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,591
is it really
a sign of the Sweat?

1086
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,509
- I thought you were joking.
- I thought I was joking, too.

1087
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,969
Well, if you were joking,
then how do you explain

1088
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,596
her eyes actually being white?

1089
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:59,098
I don't fucking know. Pink eye?

1090
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,058
- Seriously?
- Look, has anyone been

1091
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,228
in contact with her
in the last few days?

1092
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,439
I left--
I left cookies at her door.

1093
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,191
But long story.

1094
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,943
- [Wilder laughs]
- [Reed] What's so funny, weirdo?

1095
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,113
Look, guys, I-- I, um--

1096
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,157
I'm not so sure
that we should continue.

1097
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,784
Yeah, it--
it doesn't feel right.

1098
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:19,827
I think I'm--
I'm gonna go, and check on her.

1099
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,456
{\an8}No, Mara. Mara, Mara,
just stay, stay.

1100
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,166
{\an8}We should absolutely continue.
What else can we do?

1101
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,794
{\an8}No, I-- I actually think
that-- that we should

1102
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,295
{\an8}probably just end this.

1103
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:33,591
{\an8}No, Anya, we should absolutely
continue.

1104
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,551
{\an8}Nothing can be done for Selena.

1105
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,595
{\an8}- How do you know?
- Because I do.

1106
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,598
{\an8}Look, we have an obligation
to continue this class.

1107
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,975
What obligation, I can
leave whenever I want, okay?

1108
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,894
It's a free zone.

1109
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,437
{\an8}Okay, then go ahead.

1110
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,982
{\an8}"I love all who are,
like heavy drops,

1111
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,610
{\an8}falling one by one
from the dark clouds

1112
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,153
{\an8}that lowers over man.

1113
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,989
{\an8}They herald the coming
of the lightning,

1114
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,658
{\an8}and succumb to the heralds."

1115
00:51:58,908 --> 00:51:59,992
I feel sick.

1116
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,453
I'm going to call-- call Selena.

1117
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:05,623
Hey, um--

1118
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,253
I, uh--

1119
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,008
So, what are we doing?

1120
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,970
Uh, we're gonna continue.

1121
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,055
{\an8}- Really?
- Next quote.

1122
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,603
{\an8}"Lead back to the earth

1123
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,231
{\an8}the virtue that flew away,
as I do.

1124
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,194
{\an8}Back to life, back to the body,

1125
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,071
{\an8}that it may give
the earth meaning.

1126
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,324
{\an8}A human meaning."

1127
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,163
Okay.

1128
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,625
Does anyone have
anything to say?

1129
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,424
{\an8}Anyone?

1130
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,261
Mara?

1131
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:09,020
{\an8}I think that on this notion
of virtue

1132
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,356
{\an8}and the power of virtue,
I think that he's saying

1133
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,108
{\an8}that we need to ground
ourselves.

1134
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,527
{\an8}Right, but we can't
ground ourselves

1135
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,321
{\an8}in something that's unfit.

1136
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,573
{\an8}Right, but what I'm saying
is that I think we need to--

1137
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,658
{\an8}We need to find-- No, we need
to find something--

1138
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:25,870
{\an8}Hey, Wilder, I think
Mara was speaking.

1139
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,456
{\an8}- I was.
- Oh, well, I speak through her.

1140
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,665
{\an8}She speaks through me.

1141
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,251
{\an8}- No, but that isn't--
- Shh. Mara.

1142
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:34,378
{\an8}Mara. Mara.

1143
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:38,382
{\an8}I just need you to give me
a second so I can figure

1144
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,760
{\an8}these ideas out for myself.

1145
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,178
{\an8}What's the point
when your analysis

1146
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,304
{\an8}is gonna be so generic?

1147
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:44,889
{\an8}You're not moving
anything forward.

1148
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,350
{\an8}You're afraid, Mara.

1149
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,102
{\an8}- You're afraid.
- Stop telling me what I feel.

1150
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,146
{\an8}I can tell you whatever
I want to tell you.

1151
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,024
{\an8}That is not okay for you to say.

1152
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,484
{\an8}Yeah, you're right, it's not.

1153
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:03,574
{\an8}The Earth has become small,
and on it hops the last man

1154
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,493
{\an8}who makes everything small.

1155
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:09,413
{\an8}Therefore, one must sacrifice
themselves to the Earth

1156
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,248
{\an8}so that the Earth
of the superman

1157
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,751
{\an8}may hereafter arrive.

1158
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,586
{\an8}That's incomprehensible.

1159
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,297
{\an8}It's not incomprehensible.
It's so clear.

1160
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,216
{\an8}It's just difficult and--

1161
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:22,927
{\an8}and it's difficult to inhabit
and understand,

1162
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,637

this is of interest of you,

because you-- you need
to assign blame for what

1333
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,511
transpired
in my class, of course.

1334
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,096
I mean, this is--

01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:07,516
It's-- This is
an issue of liability, right?

1336

You know,
it is my responsibility

to sort of open
the door to-- to becoming,

1338

Anya, as you know,

1355
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,220
we have security cameras
all over campus.

1356
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,387
Yes.

1357
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,516
And we've been checking them
to see what might have happened

1358
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:31,850

Anya, what we're
about to share with you

01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:39,233
is strictly confidential.

1362
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,488
[Joanna] 18th September,
we have security footage

1363
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,865
of Wilder Hewitt
entering Decker Hall.

1364
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,660
That date is about a week
before the campus shut down

1365
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,329
due to a highly
infectious virus.

1366
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,874
So Wilder,
he wasn't studying science.

1367
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,086
Decker Hall is all labs.

1368
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,714
How did he get access?

1369
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,010
Only faculty have access
after 7:00 p.m., correct?

1370
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,512
That's right.

1371
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,930
Sorry, where is this going?

1372
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,601
There's significant evidence
that this Sweat, this virus

1373
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,396
that spread
all over campus was caused

1374
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:19,064
by a leak in one of those labs.

1375
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,651
So, that night,
the night of September 18th,

1376
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:25,362
was the last time Wilder Hewitt
visited Decker Hall.

1377
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,323
According to our footage,
he visited two times

1378
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,367
prior to that night on his own.

And you think
that I knew about these visits?

1381
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,509
I don't know what you knew,
but we have clear evidence

1382
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,011
that your card was used

1383
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:50,804

1390

I feel defeated.

1391
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,089
Then I hear this voice.

This voice like, inside.

1393

tells me that there is a plan.

It's not going to
be easy to understand.

But it's higher.

1396

Higher than anything

Not yet, anyway.

But I was hoping that maybe
you could help me understand it.

Because I don't think
I can do it alone.
